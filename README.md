### Project Inspiration and Early Steps
__________________________________________

While thinking about how to bring my Immersive course
to a close, I wanted to build a full-stack, single-page
app that not only entertained my interests but one that
seemed set apart from other apps 'out there.' I had already
built a theatrically-related app that aligns with my love
for and educational background in theater, a merger of
childhood loves in a minesweeper game that is thematically
set to the Jabberwocky, as well as a collaborative project
on a favorite pasttime: gaming. As soon as my mind was set
on tarot I immediately set to scaffolding the deck. I couldn't
readily find an API that would suit my needs, therfore I chose
to begin the process of isolating all properties of the card I
was going to require, such as the name, arcana, divinatory
meanings, etc. This deck was a living entity of its own...one
that frequently grew and thrived with the development of the
project. At one time it was around 700 lines, then suddenly 1,250,
back down to around 860, and finally settled around 940 lines of
code. 'Growing' this deck may have been one of the highlights of
the project in all honesty. When it came to naming the project
I chose 5 O'Clock Tarot because for obvious reasons: beard puns.
I genuinely enjoyed building this project and can without a
doubt say that I caught myself near tears several times out of
sheer pride for what I have built. I hope it doesn't make you
cry, but I hope that you, dear reader, enjoy this app as much
as I did creating it.

### Next Steps
__________________________________________

I would love to implement some degree of AWS bucket/photo
upload for users to personalize their profile page. Perhaps
even flesh out the profile page further to include more than
just past readings. Two major items I intend on working on
beyond the presentation of this project are adding more
layouts of readings as well as different deck options. I
found a really nifty resource that is fairly similar to the
one where I located all the data for this deck and the
secondary resource has more decks than you can imagine. I
would love to give the user the option to choose between
the classic RSW deck used in this app or the deck that
consists of all cat cards or the 8-bit deck. The possibilities
are endless and I think it would be really fun for me to
build out as well as for a user to be able to choose the
cards themselves.
